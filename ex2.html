    <p>Hybrid vehicles are gaining popularity in India due to their excellent mileage. In 2024, hybrid and electric vehicles combined held a 9.87% market share. Currently, there are a few hybrid SUV options, including the Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara and Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder. However, companies like Maruti, Hyundai, Kia, and Mahindra are planning to release hybrid versions of their popular SUVs soon. Let's take a look at the key features of these upcoming hybrid SUVs.</p>
    <p>Kia, Hyundai's sister company, is set to launch the Seltos Hybrid next year. This will be the South Korean carmaker's first hybrid car. The next-generation Kia Seltos is likely to get a 1.6L hybrid powertrain with an AWD system. Several changes are expected inside and out, including new seat upholstery, a new steering wheel, an ambient lighting system, a revised dashboard, door trims, and headrests.</p>
