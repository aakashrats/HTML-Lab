      <p>India made an excellent recovery with the ball to bowl <strong>Pakistan out for 241</strong> after a solid third-wicket partnership between Saud Shakeel and skipper Mohammad Rizwan gave the Men in Green hope of posting a total in excess of 300 at one point. Khushdil Shah was the last Pakistani batter to fall, holing out to <mark>Virat Kohli</mark> at deep square leg off <em>Harshit Rana's</em> bowling as the Pakistanis were bowled out with two deliveries remaining in their innings.</p>
