	India T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav was bowled over by Ashutosh Sharma's batting in the IPL 2025 match between Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants at the ACA-VDCA Stadium in Visakhapatnam on Monday. Coming to in the DC XI as an Impact Sub, Ashutosh blasted an uneaten 66 off 31 balls to help them chase down 210 in 19.3 overs with one wicket in hand. Ashutosh, who hit five maximums, finished the match with a six in the last over.

	Surya, who led MI in their season opener in regular captain Hardik Pandya's absence, took note of Ashutosh's brilliant finishing skills. He took to Instagram to share a story with Ashutosh Sharma's photo. "Grit, determination, self belief at its best. Absolute carnage from Ashutosh Sharma," he wrote.
	Screenshots of Surya's Instagram story for Ashutosh Sharma went viral after the thrilling DC vs LSG ended in the former's favour.
