	<h3>L2 Empuraan box office collection day 1: Mohanlal, Prithviraj film shatters Malayalam opening records, mints ₹21 crore.</h3>
	<p>L2 Empuraan box office collection day 1: Mohanlal has shattered every conceivable record in Malayalam cinema with the box office collection of his new film, L2: Empuraan, on day 1 itself. The Prithviraj Sukumaran film has taken the strongest possible start, minting a record ₹21 crore on day 1 in India itself. This is over twice the previous record for any Malayalam film.</p>

	<h3>L2 Empuraan box office collection day 1</h3>
	<p>Trade tracker Sacnilk reported that L2: Empuraan collected ₹21 crore net in India on day 1, obliterating the previous records. It was a Prithviraj film that had held the record before this. His 2024 release, The Goat Life, had opened to ₹8.95 crore net in India. Prior to that, it was Lucifer with a ₹6.10 crore opening in 2019. Sacnilk reported that Empuraan registered a rather strong 60% occupancy in all Malayalam shows, with regions like Kochi and Kozhikode - Mohanlal strongholds - going past 90% with almost all shows sold out.</p>
	<p>L2: Empuraan will surely set new benchmarks in box office collections for Malayalam cinema, a film industry that has been known for its content but not as much for its box office collections. Up till 2019, no Malayalam film had even grossed ₹100 crore worldwide. Lucifer changed that. As of today, only one film - Manjummel Boys - has crossed ₹200 crore. Empuraan looks all set to change that. The extended weekend will give it the best shot at doing that.</p>
